      Mother is a family of Smart Home Sensors to improve daily life. She takes care of health (e.g. medication reminder, activity and sleep tracker), safety (e.g. door and window alarms) and well-being (e.g. home heating control). I invite you to take a look at the video below to watch it in action.

      I joined the project after 2 years of R&D just before the worldwide release. I did various design and engineering tasks to make the web application responsive. I also did user research and user testing to improve the product experience.
