      I worked on ThermoPeanut from scratch with a small team of Designers and Engineers. The goal was to create a Smart Bluetooth Thermometer to monitor temperature anywhere and control home heating from a smartphone.
      <br>
      <br>
      I did various tasks from ideation to production. I worked on features, user interfaces and packaging. I also did some frontend engineering, product management and QA.

      ThermoPeanut was released in September 2016 in Berlin at IFA 2016. The product is available worldwide for $29.
