      I worked on SleepPeanut from the ground up with a small team of Designers and Engineers. The goal was to create a Smart Sleep Tracker to help people understand how they sleep and wake up everyday at the perfect time.
      <br>
      <br>
      I did various tasks from ideation to production. I worked on features, user interfaces and packaging. I also did some frontend engineering, product management and QA.

      SleepPeanut was released in January 2017 in Las Vegas at CES 2017. The product is available worldwide for $29.
