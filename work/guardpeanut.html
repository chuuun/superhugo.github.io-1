      I worked on GuardPeanut from square one with a small team of Designers and Engineers. The goal was to create a Smart Motion Alarm to protect everyday objects (e.g. bag, bike, laptop).
      <br>
      <br>
      I did various tasks from ideation to production. I worked on features, user interfaces and packaging. I also did some frontend engineering, product management and QA.
      <br>
      <br>
      GuardPeanut was released in November 2016. The product is available worldwide for $29.
